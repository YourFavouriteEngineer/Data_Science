# Week 1 – Python Setup & GitHub Intro

### 🎯 Objective
Welcome to your first week!  
You’ll learn how to:
- Install Python and a code editor  
- Write your first Python program  
- Create and upload a project to GitHub  

By the end of this week, you’ll have your **first repository live on GitHub!**

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Tasks

---

###  1. Install Your Tools

####  Install Python
1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version (≥3.10)
3. During installation, **check the box** that says **“Add Python to PATH”**
4. After installation, open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and type:
   ```bash
   python --version
Here’s your guide rewritten in clean, professional **Markdown (`.md`)** format — perfect for a `README.md` file:

# 🚀 Getting Started with Python & VS Code

## 🐍 1. Verify Python Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Python 3.12.1
```

✅ If you see this — Python is installed successfully.

---

##  2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install **VS Code**
3. Open VS Code and click the **Extensions** icon (square icon on the left sidebar)
4. Search and install the following extensions:

   * **Python** (by Microsoft)
   * **Jupyter** *(optional, for later weeks)*

### 🔗 Connect to GitHub

Click the **Settings** section in VS Code and connect your GitHub account.

## ✍️ 3. Write Your First Python Script

### Step 1 — Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository
2. Click **Code → Copy the URL**
3. In VS Code, choose **Clone from GitHub Repo → Paste the URL → Open Folder**

### Step 2 — Create a New Python File

In VS Code:

* Click **New File**
* Name it: `hello_datascience.py`

### Step 3 — Add Your First Code

Type the following:

```python
print("Hello, Data Science World!")
print("My name is <Your Name>")
print("I’m excited to start my data science journey.")
```

### Step 4 — Run Your Code

**Option 1:** Click the small ▶️ “Run” button in VS Code
**Option 2:** Open the terminal and type:

```bash
python hello_datascience.py
```

### Expected Output:

```
Hello, Data Science World!
My name is John Doe
I’m excited to start my data science journey.
```

🎉 Congratulations — you’ve just written your first Python program!

---

## 🧠 4. Add a Project Description

Create a new file named `README.md` in your repo and write a short description, for example:

```markdown
# My First Step into Data Science

This project marks the beginning of my data science journey.  
It includes my first Python program: `hello_datascience.py`,  
where I print a welcome message to the data science world!
```

---

✅ **You’re now fully set up to begin your data science journey with Python!**

---

Would you like me to format it for GitHub with emoji headers and better section dividers (like a visually polished README template)?
