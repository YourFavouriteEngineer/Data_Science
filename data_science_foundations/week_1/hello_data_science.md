#  Getting Started with Python & VS Code

##  1. Verify Python Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Python 3.12.1
```

‚úÖ If you see this ‚Äî Python is installed successfully.

##  2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install **VS Code**
3. Open VS Code and click the **Extensions** icon (square icon on the left sidebar)
4. Search and install the following extensions:

   * **Python** (by Microsoft)
   * **Jupyter** *(optional, for later weeks)*

###  Connect to GitHub

##  3. Write Your First Python Script

### Step 1 ‚Äî Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository
2. Click **Code ‚Üí Copy the URL**
3. In VS Code, choose **Clone from GitHub Repo ‚Üí Paste the URL ‚Üí Open Folder**

### Step 2 ‚Äî Create a New Python File

In VS Code:

* Click **New File**
* Name it: `hello_datascience.py`

### Step 3 ‚Äî Add Your First Code

Type the following:

```python
print("Hello, Data Science World!")
print("My name is <Your Name>")
print("I‚Äôm excited to start my data science journey.")
```

### Step 4 ‚Äî Run Your Code

**Option 1:** Click the small ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button in VS Code
**Option 2:** Open the terminal and type:

```bash
python hello_datascience.py
```

### Expected Output:

```
Hello, Data Science World!
My name is John Doe
I‚Äôm excited to start my data science journey.
```

 Congratulations ‚Äî you‚Äôve just written your first Python program!

##  4. Add a Project Description

Create a new file named `README.md`  and write a short description, for example:

```markdown
# My First Step into Data Science

This project marks the beginning of my data science journey.  
It includes my first Python program: `hello_datascience.py`,  
where I print a welcome message to the data science world!
```
